# Repo Health Audit

Give me your repository.  
I’ll show you what matters, what’s risky, what’s decaying,  
and what should never ship.

This is a **Repo Health Audit** — not a toolchain, not a runtime, not an agent.

It analyzes how a codebase evolves over time to surface:

- what changed recently
- what hasn’t changed in too long
- what has no clear ownership
- what patterns quietly increase risk
- what signals failure *before* incidents happen

This audit works by examining evidence already present in the repository:
commit history, file churn, age, clustering, and structural signals.

No runtime.  
No agents.  
No AI belief required.

Just evidence.

This is for teams who want answers *before* outages, incidents, or audits force them.
