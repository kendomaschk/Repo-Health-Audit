# Repo Health Audit

Give me your repository.
I’ll show you what matters, what’s risky, what’s decaying,
and what should never ship.

This tool analyzes how a codebase evolves over time:
- what changed recently
- what hasn’t changed in too long
- what has no clear ownership
- what patterns quietly increase risk

No runtime.
No agents.
No AI belief required.

Just evidence.
